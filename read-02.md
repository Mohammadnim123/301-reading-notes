# Pair Programming

>While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

# JQUERY

jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.

**advantages of it:**

* The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

* jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

* jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.

**JQuery structure:**

**full summery:**

jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages.

Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write
cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps:

1. Using CSS-style se lectors to collect one or more
nodes from the DOM tree.

1. Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the
elements in that selection.

jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to
select elements to work with. It also has methods that
make it easier to traverse the DOM.

jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the
event methods work across all browsers.

jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to
achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers
commonly need to perform.
