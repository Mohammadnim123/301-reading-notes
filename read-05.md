>A focus on apps
Heroku is the quickest way for a company to become an apps company. Heroku is a service that enables companies to spend their time developing and deploying apps that immediately start producing value.

>An app starts impacting the world when customers start interacting with it. Getting apps out in the wild, out onto the Internet quickly, and iterating, fast, is what can make or break companies.

>Heroku focuses relentlessly on apps and the developer experience around apps. Heroku lets companies of all sizes embrace the value of apps, not the distraction of hardware, nor the distraction of servers - virtual or otherwise.

>Why enabling developers matters
Heroku is an amazing developer experience. Heroku gets out of the way where it matters, letting devs get on with what they do best - developing apps.

>Great apps come from developers using tools and languages they love. That’s why a great developer experience has always been at the very heart of what we do. We embrace the languages of the modern app economy: Node, Ruby, Java, Scala, PHP and more.

>Heroku makes the processes of deploying, configuring, scaling, tuning, and managing apps as simple and straightforward as possible, so that developers can focus on what’s most important: building great apps that delight and engage customers.
Deploying and maintaining apps should be frictionless, and these capabilities should be a part of a company's DNA.
