>What is the "E" for? "Embedded?" Could be. How about "Effective," "Elegant," or just "Easy"? EJS is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. No religiousness about how to organize things. No reinvention of iteration and control-flow. It's just plain JavaScript.

**Use plain JavaScript:**
We love JavaScript. It's a totally friendly language. All templating languages grow to be Turing-complete. Just cut out the middle-man, and use JS!

**Fast development time:**
Don't waste time and attention figuring out arcane new syntax because 'elegance' â€” or how to preprocess your data so it will actually render right.

**Simple syntax:**
JavaScript code in simple, straightforward scriptlet tags. Just write JavaScript that emits the HTML you want, and get the job done!

**Speedy execution:**
We all know how fast V8 and the other JavaScript runtimes have gotten. EJS caches the intermediate JS functions for fast execution.

**Easy debugging:**
It's easy to debug EJS errors: your errors are plain JavaScript exceptions, with template line-numbers included.

**Active development:**
EJS has a large community of active users, and the library is under active development. We're happy to answer your questions or give you help.
